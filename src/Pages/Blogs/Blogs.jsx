          <p>
            JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a
            compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information
            between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified
            and trusted because it is digitally signed.

          <h3>When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb ?</h3>
          <p>
            MongoDB is the Document Oriented Database. MongoDB stores a lot of
            data in JSON format. MongoDB's performance is much faster than any
            RDBMS. MongoDB is designed to work with Large Scale Data. MongoDB
            can work on multiple servers. MongoDB can handle a large number of
            access requests easily. => There are 2 design patterns in
            programming. One is asynchronous programming and the other is
            synchronous programming. Node JS by default follows the Asynchronous
            pattern. That is, it does not wait for a task to be completed. In
            the meantime, NodeJS started another job. Thatâ€™s why we use nodeJS
